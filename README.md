# Legal Reasoning Framework with Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview

This project explores the advancements in legal reasoning powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By integrating multiple reasoning methods—rule-based, abductive, and case-based reasoning—with state-of-the-art LLMs, we aim to create a comprehensive and adaptable framework for legal analysis and decision-making.

## Features

- **Rule-Based Reasoning**: Utilizes explicit inference rules to derive specific conclusions from established legal principles.
- **Abductive Reasoning**: Generates plausible hypotheses and explanations for observed phenomena, particularly useful in dealing with incomplete or ambiguous information.
- **Case-Based Reasoning**: Leverages past cases and precedents to solve new legal problems through analogies and contextual understanding.
- **Unified Reasoning Framework**: Combines the strengths of rule-based, abductive, and case-based reasoning, integrated with LLMs to enhance legal analysis and decision-making processes.

## Motivations

The application of LLMs in the legal domain presents unique challenges and opportunities:
- **Efficiency**: LLMs can handle vast amounts of legal texts, statutes, and cases quickly and accurately.
- **Accuracy**: LLMs enhance the precision of legal decision-making by processing and analyzing complex legal language effectively.
- **Adaptability**: By integrating different reasoning paradigms, we provide a versatile and nuanced approach to legal analysis.

## Usage

1. **Configure API Keys**: Ensure you have access to the necessary LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT models. Set your API keys in a secure configuration file or environment variables.

2. **Run the Framework**:
   Use the provided scripts to begin integrating LLMs with rule-based, abductive, and case-based reasoning approaches.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - **Rule-Based Reasoning**:
     ```python
     from legal_reasoning import rule_thought
     result = rule_thought(facts, rules, issue)
     print(result)
     ```
   - **Abductive Reasoning**:
     ```python
     from legal_reasoning import hypo_thought
     result = hypo_thought(facts, outcomes)
     print(result)
     ```
   - **Case-Based Reasoning**:
     ```python
     from legal_reasoning import case_thought
     result = case_thought(precedent, outcome)
     print(result)
     ```

## Examples

We have included several example cases and their resolution using the unified reasoning framework:

- **Young v. Hitchens:** Examines a real-world case adapted from historical courts, demonstrating the application of different reasoning approaches.
